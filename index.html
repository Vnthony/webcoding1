			<p>Chef/Owner Matt Fulton(Union Square Cafe, Culinary Institute of America, Fantesca of Napa Valley), Prospect Height resident, knows first-hand the difficulty of planning and executing healthful and delicious meals for a young family. While focused on a carrer and parenting, he, like many parents, found himself relying more and more on delivery and take-out options, but he soon experience the budget and health busting effects this quick fix can cause. Looking for a soluting, he resolved to use his extensive restaurant and private chef experience to make life a little easier for people who, like him, faced the daily challenge of how to fit homemade, nutritionally balanced meals into their busy days. The idea for STOCKED was born.</p>
